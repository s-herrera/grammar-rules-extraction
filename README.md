# Grammar rules extraction App

This is an application to extract significant patterns, potential grammar rules, from treebanks using statistical methods.

## Description

It allows to query a treebank to statistically compare the distribution of the chosen patterns against others. 
We use [Grew-match](http://match.grew.fr/) query language to interrogate the treebanks. 
The application is build using the `streamlit` library. 


This work was done as part of an internship in the [ANR Autogramm project](https://autogramm.github.io/). It is also the implementation 
of my master's thesis (pluriTAL master's program).

## Getting Started

### Local use

1. Download this repository either by downloading and unzipping it from the website or by cloning it with git.
